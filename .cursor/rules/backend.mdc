In backend:
- Use a single object argument for all functions and methods with named properties instead of multiple parameters, For example this is good: const function=(args:{arg1:string,arg2:number})=>{}
- Always think of reusability and modularity
- For worker async services use the service bus to schedule messages (The worker will consume it)
- Don't import directly always import from the root of the repo
- Always work with interfaces first and then implement them. most of the times interfaces are already exist so check before you create new ones
- When creating new interface start with an "I" for example IParams
- Keep modules independent and avoid tight coupling between services
- Use dependency injection for services and repositories
- Write self-descriptive code without comments
- Ignore prettier errors for spacing or line breaks
- Log meaningful operations to easily trace the flow and find issues
